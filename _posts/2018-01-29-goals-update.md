title: (Update) Goals for the new year
categories: future personal

When I made [this list of
goals](https://dmaendlen.github.io/tech/future/personal/2018/01/01/goals.html),
I did certainly not anticipate what the new year would bring.

Since I value our privacy, I'll not divulge too much of what happened but let's
just say I'll now stay at home as much as I can. My priorities have shifted a
whole lot and I'll try the whole "this is a nice goal to have" thing some other
time. Let's see what the next few months will bring.

I still plan to roll out 802.1X security for my home network and I have taken
some steps towards this goal, I hope to be able to blog about this within the
next few weeks.

As to the rest of my plans, well... We shall see...
