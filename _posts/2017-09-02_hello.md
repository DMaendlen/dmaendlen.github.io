# Welcome

Dear reader,

First posts are hard. Even harder is continued blogging. So this is about the umpteenth attempt to sort my thoughts and write something of value.

In an ideal world I will be able to write about one post per week about some technical plaything that catches my interest. For today I am planning to take some notes about my current main project: Setting up [PFSense](https://www.pfsense.org) on an [APU Board](https://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B01GEIEI7M) (side note: currently these are not affiliate links. I am not planning to change this fact but you never know. You should not blindly trust anyone anyway, so do with that information what you want.)

After the PFSense works, I will use it as a replacement for my current [OpenWRT](https://www.openwrt.org) installation on a [TP Link Archer C7](https://www.amazon.de/TP-Link-Archer-C7-Dualband-Gigabit/dp/B00BUSDVBQ). Wireless connectivity will be provided by a [Ubiquity AP Pro](https://www.amazon.de/Ubiquiti-UAP-AC-PRO-Networks-weiß/dp/B016XYQ3WK/), wired connectivity will run through a [Netgear ProSafe GS108E](https://www.amazon.de/NETGEAR-GS108E-100PES-ProSAFE-8-Port-GigaBit/dp/B004BM3M6W). Since I did not do my due diligence, I accidentally overlooked the fact that the ProSafe has known vulnerabilities. This makes me rather unhappy. Please make sure you buy a better device if you want to emulate my setup.

So, what I am trying to convey in the above, rambling sentence is the simple fact that I will document my adventures into setting up a better home network than I currently have. Expect some posts concerning that.

I will probably also throw in some personal thoughts about some of my hobbies. As you can see on my [about](https://dmaendlen.github.io/about) page, I am a member of a [hackerspace](https://www.shackspace.de) in Stuttgart, do volunteer work for the [German Federal Agency for Technical Relief (THW)](https://www.thw.de) and am an active freemason (raised to the third degree in 2017) in my [mother lodge](https://www.freimaurer-esslingen.de) in Esslingen.

Maybe, just maybe, I will also shamelessly advertise for my current employer. After all, I like working there, we're currently looking for new team members and we do have a kickass team. So, if you are interested in doing IT Security consulting, you currently live in or near Tübingen (or are willing to move there) and you know your way around computers, let me know and I will put you in touch with our HR office.

And with this, dear reader, I conclude my first post for this blog and I hope, that we will see each other again.
