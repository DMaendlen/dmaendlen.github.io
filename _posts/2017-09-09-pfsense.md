title: Installing PFSense on an APU2C4 board

The goal of my current project is to change the way I connect to the internet, hopefully for the better.

TL;DR: make sure you buy the correct hardware (including cables), enable kernel support for usb-serial converters if you run Gentoo, use the right software with the right configuration, works like a charm.

My current setup is a [TP Link Archer C7](https://www.amazon.de/TP-Link-Archer-C7-Dualband-Gigabit/dp/B00BUSDVBQ), running [OpenWRT](https://www.openwrt.org/), behind a [Draytek Vigor 130](https://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B00F9E5LQA).

The Draytek is configured to run in modem mode and does nothing except that. That way I can be fairly sure, that any security problems the device might have stay well outside any network that contains sensitive data. The reason for this cautious approach is simply, that I cannot change the proprietary firmware of the device itself, so I have to consider it untrustworthy by design.

(Relevant disclaimer: Of course I do not have the time and motivation to check every single piece of code I run for NSA backdoors or the occasional bug. However, I *do* feel better with open source software. Just because I can look into the software if it need be.)

An Archer C7, for those who do not know the device, provides wireless connections at 2.4 GHz as well as 5 GHz (dualband). The relevant standard is [IEEE 802.11 ac](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_802.11ac). It also features 4 Gigabit Ethernet ports. It is fairly well made, does its job (mostly) and can be easily flashed with OpenWRT. All in all, I was quite happy about the device a few years back.

After some years of using the current setup, I have grown restless again. This has several reasons:
 * I like to learn things
 * I love to play with tech
 * Some quirks started to move from "annoyance" to "royal pain"
 * The [WAF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wife_acceptance_factor) was getting dangerously low (more on that later)

Quirks like the fact that the device randomly lost all wireless connectivity and had to be rebooted are a bit cumbersome if they appear every once in a while. If this happens almost daily and reasons for this behaviour are nowhere to be found -- I even opened the case and checked for soldering problems -- the affected device has to go. After my wife started complaining about connection losses and the reach of the wireless signal, a decision was made.

I compiled a list of requirements, functional as well as non-functional. Some of the requirements were:
 * Firewall behind the modem
 * Routing separate from Wireless (easier debugging)
 * WPA2-Enterprise
 * preferably easy to set up

With a general idea in mind, I took to my employer's intranet and posed some questions to my colleagues. Most answers were helpful, some a bit more than others and so a decision was made. [PFSense](https://www.pfsense.org) on an [APU2C4](https://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B01GEIEI7M)-Board with a 16 GB mSATA SSD for the firewall/router/radius part and a [Ubiquiti UAP Pro](https://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B016XYQ3WK) as wireless access point.

PFSense is an open source firewall distribution. It should be fairly easy to install and can be configured via a simple web interface. At least, so I thought.

I even made sure to purchase a [DB9 USB-Serial converter cable](https://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B00QUZY4UG) and a matching [female - female gender changer](https://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B000LB4N3I). Little did I know that this was the wrong decision.

After downloading the PFSense firmware and writing it to a USB thumbdrive, I put the thumbdrive into the APU's USB slot and powered the device.

```bash
# Get firmware
curl -O https://frafiles.pfsense.org/mirror/downloads/pfSense-CE-memstick-serial-2.3.4-RELEASE-amd64.img.gz

# unpack firmware
gunzip pfSense-CE-memstick-serial-2.3.4-RELEASE-amd64.img.gz

# write firmware to thumbdrive
dd if=pfSense-CE-memstick-serial-2.3.4-RELEASE-amd64.img of=/dev/sdb bs=1M
```

Unfortunately, nothing happened on my computer. At all. After researching, why my (na√Øve) approach did not work, I realised that I had more work in front of me than expected.

First of all, I had to set my kernel up for USB-Serial connections. After all, one of the favourite pastimes of a regular Gentoo system is the game of "Nice project you have there. Would be a shame if you had to recompile your kernel." (Imagine the previous complaint in the affectionate voice of an older brother.)

Fortunately, the Gentoo wiki, as almost always, has a useful [configuration recipe](https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/USB/Guide#Config_options_for_the_kernel) for your kernel. After you're done changing the kernel config, compiling and installing the kernel and finally rebooting to the new kernel, you are set up for success.

Or not.

You still need a connection to the device. I have used [minicom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minicom). I recommend that you do the same.

```bash
# install minicom on a Gentoo system
emerge -av net-dialup/minicom

# run minicom on ttyUSB0
minicom -D /dev/ttyUSB0
```

You can also use screen but I never got that to work. After starting minicom, hit ```^C-A z``` to enter the menu, after that hit ```O```, choose ```Serial port setup``` and make sure that ```Bps/Par/Bits``` is set to ```115200 8N1```. Otherwise your connection will never work. Minicom will automatically save those settings if you agree to that and you will not have to bother with this specific problem again. At least not until someone changes the way the settings are handled.

Now, connect the APU to the gender changer, the gender changer to the DB9-cable and the USB-part of that cable to your computer. Start minicom once again. Power the device. Get suspicious. Discern that you have a problem.

Not-so-fun-fact: The USB-Serial-converter cable I mentioned is incompatible to the APU's DB9 port. I overlooked this fact. The price I had to pay is a rather ugly construction of jumper wires and a now useless gender changer.

To connect my specific cable to the APU's DB9 port without running into trouble, you have to use jumper wires to cross pin 2 and 3. This is documented on the [PC Engines website](https://www.pcengines.ch/ht_com.htm). If you have not yet bought the wrong cable, I suggest you buy a matching one there.

After getting a connection on the serial port via minicom, the rest of the installation is basically telling the autoinstaller to do it's thing. If you have special requirements regarding the installation you can also use a custom installer but I expect that in that case you probably don't need my help there.

After the installation finishes, you can then use the serial console to configure your device's LAN ports, enable sshd and start the web interface. After that you can log into the web interface with ```admin:pfsense``` as credentials. I suggest you change those. Quickly.

The initial configuration will be covered in another post, as will the adventure of getting the Ubiquiti controller to work.
