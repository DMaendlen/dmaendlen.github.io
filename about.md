Dave is doing IT security consulting for a German consulting firm specialising
in -- you guessed it -- IT security. Main focus of his work currently can be
summarised by "knows how to break web{applications,services}".

He knows how to use the tools of the trade and sometimes actually has to offer
advice on some topics. This blog is about the umpteenth attempt at writing more
or less regularly about interesting technical stuff. Since just technical
blogging would be too boring, some private thoughts might get mixed in as well.

On the private side, Dave is married to an amazing system tester for a
multinational company and father to an aspiring young hacker who utilises
malicious compliance to the fullest extent while still sleeping in their parents
bed.

In his (rare) spare time, Dave likes to visit the [local
hackerspace](https://www.shackspace.de), volunteers at the local branch of the
[German Federal Agency for Technical Relief](https://www.thw.de) or tries to
broaden his horizon by being an active
[freemason](https://www.freimaurer-esslingen.de).
